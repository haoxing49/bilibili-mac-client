Features:
	- Save and restore window bounds @done using NS autosave for BrowserWindow.xib with key "browserWindow"
	- Toolbar support (optional, controlled by CTBrowserWindowController) @done
Bugs:
	- We are leaking like an old umbrella somewhere with CTBrowser and CTBrowserWindowController I think. @done (well, at least it seems to be fixed)
	- The top of the window gets darker when "enough" tabs are in it. Why? @done (fixed by CTBrowserWindow and friends)
